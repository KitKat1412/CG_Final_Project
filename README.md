# The Life and Death of Flotsam the Fish
Final project for Computer Graphics Lab 2018
Created by Katherine Durant and Sütő Ágoston

The program can be run by using the atom-live-server in the Atom IDE, or through another live server or IDE of your choice.

The main code is located in main.js
The howto document explains how to navigate through the scene using a keyboard once you are viewing it through a live server.

This code mostly uses OpenGL and GLSL to create the graphics.
